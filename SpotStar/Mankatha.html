            Mankatha (pronounced [maŋɡaːtaː]) is a 2011 Indian Tamil-language action crime film written and directed by Venkat Prabhu. <br>
            It stars Ajith Kumar in his 50th film, along with an ensemble cast including Arjun Sarja, Trisha Krishnan, Lakshmi Rai, Anjali, Andrea Jeremiah, <br>
            Vaibhav Reddy, Premji Amaren, and Mahat Raghavendra . It was produced by Dhayanidhi Alagiri's Cloud Nine Movies while Yuvan Shankar Raja composed<br>
            the musical score and soundtrack, with Sakthi Saravanan working as the cinematographer and the duo Praveen K. L. and N. B. Srikanth as editors. <br>
            The story, set in Mumbai, revolves around a heist of cricket betting money, executed by a gang of four thieves, <br>
            who are joined by a fifth unknown man, and its aftermath.<br>
            <br>
            The film was formally launched in August 2010, with its principal photography beginning on 25 October 2010. <br>
            Filming was held for more than eight months and took place primarily across Chennai, the Dharavi slum in Mumbai and Bangkok, Thailand. <br>
            Following speculations regarding the film's release, Sun Pictures acquired the theatrical rights and distributed the film via Raadhika's Radaan Mediaworks. <br>
            Mankatha released on 31 August 2011 worldwide to generally positive reviews and grossed the second biggest opening of all time after Enthiran at the time of release.<br>
