            The trailer for Marvel's Iron Man 3, in UK and Irish cinemas NOW. <br>

Marvel's "Iron Man 3" pits brash-but-brilliant industrialist Tony Stark/Iron Man against an enemy whose reach knows no bounds. When Stark finds his personal world destroyed at his enemy's hands, he embarks on a harrowing quest to find those responsible. This journey, at every turn, will test his mettle. With his back against the wall, Stark is left to survive by his own devices, relying on his ingenuity and instincts to protect those closest to him. As he fights his way back, Stark discovers the answer to the question that has secretly haunted him: does the man make the suit or does the suit make the man? Marvel's Iron Man 3 is in UK cinemas now.<br><br>

Starring Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Guy Pearce, Rebecca Hall, Stephanie Szostak, James Badge Dale with Jon Favreau and Ben Kingsley, Marvel's "Iron Man 3" is directed by Shane Black from a screenplay by Drew Pearce & Shane Black and is based on Marvel's iconic Super Hero Iron Man, who first appeared on the pages of "Tales of Suspense" (#39) in 1963 and had his solo comic book debut with "The Invincible Iron Man" (#1) in May of 1968.<br><br>

"Iron Man 3 is smart, funny and spectacular."  4 stars - The Guardian<br><br>

"Witty one-liners, a droll superhero and Gwyneth Paltrow beating up baddies -- saving the world has never been more fun."  4 stars -- Daily Mail
